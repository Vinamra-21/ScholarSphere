# Personal Education Records Verification through Blockchain

## Overview

In the digital age, verifying educational qualifications can be cumbersome and unreliable. Our project addresses these challenges by leveraging blockchain technology to create a secure, accessible system for verifying personal education records. 

This platform ensures the integrity of educational records through a decentralized, tamper-proof ledger, allowing users to manage their records with ease and enabling institutions and employers to verify credentials quickly and accurately.

## Key Features

- **Blockchain Security:** Immutable and tamper-proof storage of educational records.
- **User Empowerment:** Unique digital identities for managing and updating records.
- **Streamlined Verification:** Efficient and reliable verification process.
- **Enhanced Accessibility:** User-friendly interface for managing records.
- **Future-Proof Technology:** Integration with evolving blockchain capabilities.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your system. You can check your Node.js version by running:

```bash
node -v
```

### Installation

1. **Install Dependencies**

   Navigate to the project directory and install the necessary dependencies using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run the Development Server**

   Start the development server to run the application locally:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   By default, the development server will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.
   or the next port which is free.

## Usage

Once the development server is running, you can access the application in your browser. 

- **User Registration:** Users can register and receive a unique digital identity.
- **Record Management:** Users can add, update, and manage their educational records.
- **Verification:** Institutions and employers can verify the authenticity of records using the provided verification interface.
